 + add runtime evaluation of svmax to class t_argon DONE
 + solve "particle array full" error for non-zero dt with neutral particles DONE
 + implement adaptive lifetime ... it is not needed actually
 - possible optimization is to precompute the sigma*v during initialization, saves one sqrt()
 - possible optimization: compute the null collision cross section and check it first
 - possible optimization: resolve special treatment of equdistantly sampled sigma
 - check if all possible e-O2 interactions are implemented
 - implement collisions O2+ - Ar
 - maybe implement elastic collision O2+ - O2
 - change the lifetime during equilibriation ???
